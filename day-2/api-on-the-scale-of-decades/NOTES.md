# Part 1: what can you afford?
## Affordance
1. how an actor sees the *actional* properties of the world
    - Trees in nature provide different actions for different animals
        - a hunting blind for leopards
        - a food source for birds
        - a hammock for sloths
    - However, the tree doesn't _instruct_ the animal on how to use it, it simply provides actionable features the animals use for their use-case
1. **Affordance is Documentation**

## Perceived Affordance
1. Example:  the image of a floppy disk implies the "save" action
    - you don't necessarily save to a disk
    - if you did it, it wouldn't be a floppy

## Part 2: The form of things
1. Example: Cat
    - given name
    - family name
    - birth date
    - address

## Part 3: No Rest for the Wicked
- Information + Control = Better API
- not just one or the other, **but both**
- in other words:
    - Action contextualizes information, information contextualizes information

## Part 4: Change
- [The Ship of Theseus and the problem of identity](https://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/320/theseus.html)
- the Mereological theory of Identity
- the Spatio-Temporal Continuity of Identity
- AKA, versioning problems
    - v1.x.x vs v2.x.x
- Biomimicry
    - maybe _don't version things_?
    - **affordance trumps versioning**
    - _what version of Github are we on?_
        - operators of Github _don't need to know what version we're on_ to use github

## Part 5: Testing
- cars have brakes to go faster
- build your APIs for _inevitable_ change

## Write your APIs in HTML5
- HTML5 has:
    - links
    - forms
    - structures
    - types
    - tooling

### Generic vs specific controls
- standardised across collections
- surprisingly poor implemented across clients
