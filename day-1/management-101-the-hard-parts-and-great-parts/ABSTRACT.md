Presented by: [Ryan Riddell](https://www.codemash.org/speaker-details?id=5f064b10-2d37-461c-a20e-162b5b2bf2db)
Time: Thursday, Jan. 10, 4:45 PM - 5:45 PM
Deciding on a career path is one of the most challenging and frequently delayed decisions facing engineers. This session will cover a three year management journey, starting on day one and ending today. A journey described as "a trial by fire", "thrown into the deep end" and "successful". How do you respond to unexpected events in someone's personal life (e.g., "my wife left me last night")? What are the worst parts of management? What are the best parts of management? What tools will help a new manager? Find out the answers to these questions and more. You'll leave this session with a much better understanding of what it means to be a successful manager and if it's right for you. You'll also leave with some tools to help you should you decide to make the leap.
